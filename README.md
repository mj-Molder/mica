_Here's my latest profile that I've written up:_

Since you're here, you probably want to know a little bit about me. I'm a Full Stack Engineer working in Web Development. I'm all about making sure I help my team out however I can, but in my time away from work, I'm your quintessential nerd.

Video games, creating video games, programming, anime, plain old tv (With a surname like mine, you'd better believe I grew up on X-Files). I'm majorly into all of it. I'm even a bit of a music geek. Aside from that, I'm big on crafts and like to sew and draw when I'm not in front of a screen
